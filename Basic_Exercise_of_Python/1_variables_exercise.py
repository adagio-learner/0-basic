# Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables.

birth_year = 2007
current_year = 2025

your_age = current_year - birth_year
print(your_age)


# Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables.

first_name = "harsh"
middle_name = "verdan"
last_name = "singh"

print(first_name +" "+ middle_name +" "+ last_name)
